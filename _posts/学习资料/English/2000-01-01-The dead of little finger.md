**Sansa** : Have  my sister brought to the Great Hall.

**Arya** : Are you sure you want to do this.

**Sansa** : It's not what I want, It's what honor demands.

**Arya** : And what does honor demands ?

**Sansa** : That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.

**Aray** : All right. Then. Get on with it.

**Sansa** : You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges. Lord Baelish.

**Aray** : My sister asked you a question.

**Baelish** : Lady Sansa. Forgive me. I'm a bit confused.

**Sansa** : Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one.  you murdered our aunt Lysa arryn. You pushed her through Moon door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?

**Baelish** : I did it to protect you.

**Sansa** : You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier you conspired to murder Jon Arryn. You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him. Do you deny it?

**Baelish** : Whatever you aunt might have told you. She was a troubled woman. She imagined enemies everywhere.

**Arya** : You had aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn. When really It was you.

**Sansa** : The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters. It was you who started it. Do you deny it.

**Baelish** : I know of no such letter.

**Sansa** : You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father Ned Stark. Thanks to your treachery. he was imprisoned. And later executed on flase charges of treason. Do you deny it?

**Baelish** : I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.

**Brane** : You hold a knife to his throat. You said 'I did warn you not the trust me'.

**Arya** : You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister. But that was another one of your lies. It was yours.

**Baelish** : Lady Sansa. I have know you since you were a girl. I've protected you.

**Sansa** : Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons ?

**Baelish** : If you could speak alone. I can explain everything.

**Sansa** : Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives. I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sister. That's what you do. Isn't it ? That's what you have always done turn family against family. Turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa. And that's what you tried to do to us.

**Baelish** : Sansa. Please.

**Sansa** : I'm a slow learner. It's true. But I learn.

**Baelish** : Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that. I'm Lord protector of the Vale. And I command you to escort me safely back to the Vale.

**SomeOne** : I think not.

**Baelish** : Sansa. I beg you. I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.

**Sansa** : And yet. You betrayed her.

**Baelish** : I loved you. More than anyone.

**Sansa** : And yet. You betrayed me. When you brought me back to Winterfell. You tell me there's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. Thank you for all you many lessons. Lord Baelish. I'll never forget them.
